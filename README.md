This repository contains two related projects:

- [`TodoApi`](./TodoApi): A REST API for managing todo lists and items.
- [`TodoApi MCP`](./TodoApi%20MCP): A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows interaction with the API through natural language using Claude Desktop.

To learn how to run each part of the system, please refer to the README files inside each folder:

- **[TodoApi README](./TodoApi/README.md)**
